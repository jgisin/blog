		<p>The journey to web development starts here. My name is Jeffrey Gisin and I'll be detailing my path to a new career. Big thanks to <a href="www.vikingcodeschool.com">Viking Code School</a> for giving me the opportunity to start on this path to self re-invention. I'll be organizing all the tutorials, guides, articles, and anything else that I feel does a good job. </p>
		<p>My first tasks are to learn, learn, and learn again. CSS, HTML5, Javascript, Ruby, Agile Development, Rails, AngularJS, NodeJS. All of these things and more are to become second nature...</p>
